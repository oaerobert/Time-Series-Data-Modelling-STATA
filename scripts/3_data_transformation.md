# Transforming Data 🫳🏾
------
Here we are going to look at transforming the data we have been analysing into logarithms and carrying out regressions to perform hypothesis tests. We do this as econometricians to linearise the nonlinear pattern between consumption and income. This makes this model more appropriate for regression.

### Step 1: Generate our variables! 👁

For all our variables built into our workshop, we must logarise them as follows:
  ``` stata
  gen lcons = ln(consumption)
gen linc = ln(income)
gen lprice = ln(price)
gen lintr = ln(longterminterestrates)
   ```
This transforms all our existing variables into their logarithms. This is needed for the next stage of this project. If you have decided to run/execute this code, ensure you delete it once they've been generated so STATA does not produce an error for the consequencing stages.

We also want to include an inflation variable: we do this by pasting:
  ``` stata
gen infl = lprice-l1.lprice
  ``` 
This generates inflation as the log of price (which we just generated) today, subtracted by it's lag/yesterday's price.

- PRACTICE QUESTION: Why do you think the first observation of inflation is missing? 😯

### Step 2: Estimating a log-linear consumption function 🕺💃

A simple log-linear consumption function can be written as: $consumption_t = A(income_t)^{\beta_1}$

Taking the natural logarithm gives: $ln(consumption_t) = ln(A) + {\beta_1}ln(income_t)$ or more simply, 
- ### $lcons_t = {\beta_0} + {\beta_1}linc_t + {\epsilon}_t$
  
Where we include the error term 'epsilon' to account for all other effects that may have been excluded. It is what essentially determines the linearity of a function.

Let's regress this now, I'm sure you know how this is done, but incase you forgot ...
  ``` stata
reg lcons linc

  ```
Which will lead you to producing a regression that looks like the following: [Here](Images_DT/Regression_lcons_linc.png)
