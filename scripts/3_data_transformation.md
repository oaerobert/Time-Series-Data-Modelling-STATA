# Transforming Data 🫳🏾
------
Here we are going to look at transforming the data we have been analysing into logarithms and carrying out regressions to perform hypothesis tests. We do this as econometricians to linearise the nonlinear pattern between consumption and income. This makes this model more appropriate for regression.

By the end of this file, you shall:

✅ Transform data using logarithms for better intepretation. 

✅ Visualise fitted consumption values and residuals using line graphs.

### Step 1: Generate our variables! 👁

For all our variables built into our workshop, we must logarise them as follows:
  ``` stata
  gen lcons = ln(consumption)
gen linc = ln(income)
gen lprice = ln(price)
gen lintr = ln(longterminterestrates)
   ```
This transforms all our existing variables into their logarithms. This is needed for the next stage of this project. If you have decided to run/execute this code, ensure you delete it once they've been generated so STATA does not produce an error for the consequencing stages.

We also want to include an inflation variable: we do this by pasting:
  ``` stata
gen infl = lprice-l1.lprice
  ``` 
This generates inflation as the log of price (which we just generated) today, subtracted by it's lag/yesterday's price.

- PRACTICE QUESTION: Why do you think the first observation of inflation is missing? 😯

### Step 2: Estimating a log-linear consumption function 🕺💃

A simple log-linear consumption function can be written as: $consumption_t = A(income_t)^{\beta_1}$

Taking the natural logarithm gives: $ln(consumption_t) = ln(A) + {\beta_1}ln(income_t)$ or more simply, 
- ### $lcons_t = {\beta_0} + {\beta_1}linc_t + {\epsilon}_t$
  
Where we include the error term 'epsilon' to account for all other effects that may have been excluded. It is what essentially determines the linearity of a function.

Let's regress this now: I'm sure you know how this is done, but incase you forgot, it's ...
  ``` stata
reg lcons linc

  ```
This will lead you to producing a regression that looks like the following: [Here](Images_DT/Regression_lcons_linc.png)

Are you capable of interpreting this data now? I'll ask you a few questions to test your understanding. Write down the answers and revisit the answers once you've figured them out independently. 😇

### Question Time: ☄️
1. How do we intepret the slope parameter in this regression?
2. Is it significant? Which statistics in this results table indicate the significance of 'linc'?
3. Do these results show that we have an income elasticity of unity? Calculate an appropriate t-statistic to show this using:
   
     ``` stata
     test linc=1
     ```
4. Do you think there appears to be an easier way, given the results in the table, to provide the same conclusion?
5. Can we uncover the original constant, $A$? Show that it equates to 0.833

### Answers: 🌝

1. The slope parameter is ${\beta_1}$, which according to our regression is `1.007548`. This is the income elasticity of consumption. In other words, a 1% increase in income leads to an approx. 1.007548% increase in consumption ($lcons$). As the value is very close to one, it suggest that their growth is almost exactly proportional.
2. Based on the t-test being very high, and the p-value being below the significance level, we can conclude that this value is indeed significant (that beta one is not equal to zero). If you are unsure how so, take a look at the previous project of `Regression Analysis` that explains why.
3. Income elasticity of unity is when the income elasticity (of consumption in this context) equates to one, or is not significantly different from one. We can carry out a t-test to determine this - it will be structured like:

   $H_0: \beta_1 = 1$
   
   $H_a: \beta_1 \neq 1$

   $t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1 - \beta_1}{SE(\hat{\beta}_1)}$ = $t = \frac{{1.007548} - 1}{0.0068624}$ = `1.01`

   Our d.f. = n - 2 = 60, hence our critical value using the Statistical Tables found [Here](Statistical_Tables.pdf) which is: `2.000` given this is a two-tailed test at 5% SL.

This suggests we have insufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that we have income elasticity of unity.
   
4. Yes - there is, we can inspect the confidence interval for $\beta_1$. Since 1 lies within the 95% confidence intervail we fail to reject the null that $\beta_1 = 1$ 🌈
5. Yes we can, think about the formulas though. If $\beta_0$ = $ln(A)$ then we can use Euler's number to find $A$. Hence, $e^{\beta_0} = A$ = $e^{cons} = e^{-0.1828456} = 0.833$

✅ Well Done! Now, onto the next! 🥳

### Step 3: Let's extend our model! 🥵

- Suppose we want to extend our model by including inflation and the log of interest rate as an additional regressor to give the following model:

$lcons_t = \beta_0 + {\beta_1}linc_t + {\beta_2}infl_t + {\beta_3}lintr_t + {\epsilon}_t$

We would type into **STATA**:
``` stata
reg lcons linc infl lintr
```
*Hint:* The order beyond $lcons$ doesn't really matter! Mix and match it up as you wish! 🤭

This would produce a regression such as the [following](Images_DT/Regression_multivariate_DT.png) into our **STATA** `.do` file.
